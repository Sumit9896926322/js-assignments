      <h1>JQuery Challenges</h1>
      <p>
        For this week, you have three small challenges to complete. Please don't
        add or remove HTML/CSS code as it will not be necessary for finishing
        these tasks. You should only be adding JQuery code to the script tag
        located directly before the closing body tag. Make sure you read
        everything carefully so you don't miss any requirements. Your code
        should be placed beneath the line which says "// Place all code for your
        challenges below this line."
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h2>Challenge 1</h2>
      <p>
        Add code so that when the paragraph below is clicked, it disappears. You
        can achieve this effect with the jquery hide() method. Example 1 from
        this week's class example includes code which demonstrates how to add a
        click event to an element. Example 5 contains code which shows how to
        use $(this) to refer to the element the event has occured on.
      </p>
      <p id="hideMe">Click to hide me.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Challenge 2</h2>
      <p>
        Add code so that when text is typed into the input below, that same text
        also appears inside of the empty paragraph below ("outputArea"). You'll
        need to use the keyup, html, and val methods in order to do this one.
        Example 6 from this week's example shows how to use the .val() method to
        get the value of an input box.
      </p>
      <label for="inputArea">Enter some text:</label>
      <input id="inputArea" type="text" />
      <p id="outputArea"></p>
      <hr />

      <h2>Challenge 3</h2>
      <p>
        Add code so that when the button below is clicked, the image will fade
        in or fade out. You can accomplish this with the fade in/fade out or
        fade toggle methods.
      </p>
      <button id="toggleImage" type="button">Toggle Image</button><br />
      <img class="img" src="https://place-hold.it/300" alt="dummy image" />
      <hr />
    </div>

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      $(document).ready(function () {
        // Place all code for your challenges below this line
        $("#hideMe").click(function () {
          console.log("Hello");
          $(this).hide();
        });

        $("#inputArea").keyup(function () {
          $("#outputArea").html($(this).val());
        });

        $("#toggleImage").click(function () {
          $(".img").fadeToggle();
        });
        // Challenge 1
        /* 
                You should add a click event to #hideMe. You can then refer to the element
                that is clicked with $(this) and then use the .hide() method to hide it.
            */
        // Challenge 2
        /* 
                You should add a keyup event to #inputArea. Inside of the curly brackets 
                for the function, you would then target #outputArea with .html() to change
                the HTML inside of it. Inside of .html(), you will put the value of the input 
                using $(this) and .val(). $(this) always refers to the element that has the 
                event happening to it. .val() refers to the value of an input box similar to
                the .value property in regular JavaScript.
            */
        // Challenge 3
        /* 
                You should add a click event to #toggleImage similar to how you added a click
                event in Challenge 1. Inside of the function, you will target the image (.img) 
                and then use the .fadeToggle() function to make it toggle back and forth.
            */
